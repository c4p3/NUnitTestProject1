In Denmark 2007, the grading system changed.
The system needed to be adaptable for the international system. 
The "13-skala" had 10 values ranging from 00 to 13,
the new scala, "7-trin-skala" has 7 values, ranging from -3 to 12.

The test, tests if the input from the old scale, converts to the
correct value in the new scale. 

This is done by giving the ConvertGrade() method an int from 
the old scale, and if it equals the expected value, the test will pass.

It is written in C# with the nUnit test framework.
